This is a bash script to install all major versions of Firefox on OS X

Currently it installs:

- Firefox 2.0.0.20
- Firefox 3.0.19
- Firefox 3.6.24
- Firefox 4.0.1
- Firefox 5.0.1
- Firefox 6.0.1
- Firefox 7.0.1
- Firefox 8.0.1

The script downloads the en-GB locale .dmg files from mozilla's FTP into /tmp/firefoxes.

The script installs these to /Applications/Firefoxes/


INSTALLATION:

From a terminal prompt enter the following
    curl -L https://github.com/omgmog/install-all-firefox/raw/master/firefox.sh | bash

That's it, then just wait for the whole process to complete.


TODO:
- Automate setting up of profiles for each version of Firefox (if possible)
- Add ability to specify locale as a parameter
- Add ability to specify additional versions
