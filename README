This is a bash script to install all major versions of Firefox on OS X

Currently it installs:

- Firefox 2.0.0.20
- Firefox 3.0.19
- Firefox 3.6.24
- Firefox 4.0.1
- Firefox 5.0.1
- Firefox 6.0.1
- Firefox 7.0.1
- Firefox 8.0.1

The script downloads the en-GB locale .dmg files from mozilla's FTP into /tmp/firefoxes.

The script installs these to /Applications/Firefoxes/


INSTALLATION:

From a terminal prompt enter the following

    curl -L -O https://github.com/omgmog/install-all-firefox/raw/master/install-all-firefox.sh
    chmod +x install-all-firefox.sh
    ./install-all-firefox.sh

The script will download the 'bits' (icons, utils) for the rest of the installer.

When the Mozilla license pops up, press Q and then Y to continue.

It'll take a little while to grab the .dmg files, but it should only need to do this once.


Update: 24/11/11
- Implemented automatic profile creation and launcher modification
- Added custom icon for each version


TODO:

- Add checks for existing install to skip reinstall
- Add check for local 'bits' folder (if whole branch mirrored locally)
